# Distro_Package_setup

This is my first attempt at automating package installation to make distro hopping a little quicker. I am sure I screwed up somewhere.
The script is designed to detect which distro you're using and then using the appropriate package manager to install a couple packages. I just added the ones I akways install during initial setup.
